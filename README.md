README

This machine learning package is written in Java. It is mainly written during my research progress. When I need to use a machine learning algorithm, but I find that it is hard to use other tools, such as weka. Then I will write by my self. In the current time, I just write the linear regression with L2 regularization. If you want to run the program, you can go to the linear-regression subdirectory and view the README file.
If you have question, please contact me(xiejuncs@gmail.com or xie@eecs.oregonstate.edu)
